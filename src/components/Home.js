      <p id="about-me">
          My name is Kyaah Ellis. I'm a 26 year old, currently living in Chicago, Illinois. In the past i've worked in
          many
          different environments. Some of my past job fields included customer service, mailroom clerk and my most
          exciting
          a chef which I got from going and obtaining my degree from Le Cordon Bleu. Currently, I attend the Coding
          Bootcamp
          at Northwestern and even though my career path hasn't been linear, it has exposed me to many different
          environments, people and skills which has made me a quick learner and great at adapting in foreign spaces.</p>
